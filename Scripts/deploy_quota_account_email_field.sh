# Deploy the v0.27.0 build 65.3 schema change — adding `accountEmail`
# to the `QuotaTransition` CKRecord type — to CloudKit Production.
#
# Without this step, new Mac builds (65.3+) that try to write
# `accountEmail` to a QuotaTransition record will be rejected by
# Production schema validation and push notifications will silently
# stop firing.
#
# Two modes:
#
# 1) `cktool` mode (preferred, fully automated). Requires:
#    - A CloudKit Management Token (Dashboard → Container → Tokens)
#    - `cktool save-token --type management --token "$TOKEN"`
#    Then run this script with no args.
#
# 2) Manual Dashboard mode (fallback). The script prints the steps
#    when no token is available.
#
# Either way, after the deploy completes, the script verifies the
# field is present in the live Production schema by exporting it
# and grepping for `accountEmail`.

==> cktool needs a management token. Two paths:

    A) Save a token first (one-time setup):
       1. Open https://icloud.developer.apple.com
       2. Select container iCloud.com.ian902792.codexbar
       3. Tokens → Create Management Token (full schema scope)
       4. xcrun cktool save-token --type management --token "<paste>"
       5. Re-run this script.

    B) Manual Dashboard deploy (no token needed):
       1. Open https://icloud.developer.apple.com
       2. Container iCloud.com.ian902792.codexbar → Schema
       3. Record Types → QuotaTransition
       4. Add Field: accountEmail (String)
       5. Click "Deploy Schema Changes to Production"
       6. Choose accountEmail and confirm
       7. After deploy, re-run this script to verify.

  ⚠️  RACE WARNING ⚠️
  `cktool import-schema` has FULL-SCHEMA OVERWRITE semantics. If
  another developer has added a Dev schema field on this container
  since we fetched the schema 2 lines up, that field will be WIPED
  by the import below. Window is ~5 seconds in practice.

  Verify Dev schema editor in Dashboard is closed before proceeding.
